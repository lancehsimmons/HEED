## API
<https://api.nasa.gov/>

Asteroids - NeoWs
NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.

Data-set: All the data is from the NASA JPL Asteroid team (http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/).

## MVP objectives

- Incorporate the NASA Asteroids - NeoWs API

- Fully functioning in browser app utilizing html, javascript, and styled with css

- App Functionality: user gives HEED a date and HEED returns all "potentially hazardous asteroids." Info for each NEOo will include at least size, speed, and "miss distance." An additional return will include the top three non-hazardous NEOo with the same data. This should account for the eventuality of returning no PHA NEOo.

### Post MVP objectives

- animated "tone" styling for both hazardous and non-hazardous
- asteroid animation (in background?): when the search lands asteroid impacts the page
- historical links for asteroid impacts
